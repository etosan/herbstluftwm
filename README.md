# herbstluftwm-eto

This is **eto's personal fork of herbstluftwm**, an manual tiling window manager for X. 

*It means, it has hacks applied, that are specific to my usage of herbst (herbstluftwm).
For list of hacks see [1](#hacks).*

I hate when project forks don't have default project text modified, and nobody knows how much fork
is modified compared to original thing or what purpose it has. 

So I wrote these paragraphs to set an example. It's much more pleasant to read short prose here, 
than to jump to fork parent, to read exactly same text.

Here is original description:

> Hlwm is licensed under the "Simplified BSD License" (see `LICENSE`).
>
> - the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split again or can be filled with windows (similar to i3/ musca)
> - tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or â€¦) can be added/removed at runtime. Each tag contains an own layout
> - exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor independent (similar to xmonad)
> - it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to wmii/ musca)

**As such this fork should be considered officially unsupported.**

If so, why does it exist then?

So you really want to know?

As you insist, I have to answer, but I will use this opportunity for tiny "tiling window manager proganda" as well.

Don't get mad, but as I am quite the "useless talker", I have short little, perhaps almost too personal, story to go with it:

> I was Linux neophyte, you could say. I am also quite opinionated asshole too.

> Some say it's hubris. So be aware before reading further. It's your call.

> I was finally leaving the Windows pastures for good, fleeing like rat, just before Vista disaster.
> On the side note, windows users never mentally and physically recovered from this dreadful event, 
> and windows lands will never be the same. I can still feel their shellshock, when meeting them, years after.
> They all lost sparkle in their eye, turning into husks.
>
> After lot of pondering, I gave few BSDs a try and my heart rejoiced - at last, I finally returned to "sane" systems.

> These OSes reminded me so much of my belowed DOS environment, I grew up in as a child, that after taking

But you know, being an asshole and all, after some time, I got tired waiting for some tiny changes to land 
into herbst. Changes probably only I would like to have happen.

And I am still not willing to upset The Manager. 

And that is kids, why this fork exists. I make some small hacks here and there to bend herbst better to my will.

Somebody might find them useful someday. That's why this fork is here.

# Hacks

This herbst fork has following hacks done to it:

- skip_cycle attribute for monitors 
  - each monitor has skip_cycle attribute. 
  - by setting this attribute to 'true' you remove monitor from monitor cycle,
    essentially removing it from monitor rotation.
